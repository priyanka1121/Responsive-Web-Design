         <h2>Quotes from Steve</h2>
         <blockquote>
          “We don’t get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our
          life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? And we’ve all chosen to do this with our lives. So it better
          be damn good. It better be worth it.”
         </blockquote>
         <blockquote>
             "My favorite things in life don't cost any money. It's really clear that the most precious resource we all
             have is time."
         </blockquote>

             <ul>
                 <li>Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple in <strong>
                     1977</strong>, introducing first the Apple I and then the
                     Apple II.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Apple went public in <strong>1980</strong> with Jobs the blazing visionary and Wozniak the shy
                        genius executing
                        his vision.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Executive John Scully was added in 1983; in <strong>1985</strong>, Apple's board of directors
                        ousted the
                        combative Jobs in favor of Scully.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Away from Apple, Jobs invested in and developed animation producer Pixar and then founded NeXT
                        to create high-end computers; NeXT eventually led him back to Apple.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Jobs returned to Apple in the late 1990s and spent the years until his death in
                        <strong>2011</strong> revamping
                        the company, introducing the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, transforming technology and communication
                        in the process.
